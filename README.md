# Hello-World
Here we go




I'm on the verge of greatness. My skills are a mere sprout at this point and I'm open to any suggestions although I'll take only the
true, honest advice. I find it hard to listen to just anyone these days. Half of the people speak without thinking about it. So I've been told it's best to follow your own intuition.
